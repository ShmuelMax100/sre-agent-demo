# Internal Changelog

This append-only log records implementation changes by date.

### 2026-10-14 - Update fork onboarding after canonical repository transfer

- Updated the canonical repository identity from `msftse/sre-agent-demo` to `msftse-org/sre-agent-demo` in fork validation and first-run guidance.
- Restored `setup-colleague.sh` compatibility with forks created after the organization transfer while preserving the canonical-repository safety boundary.
- Corrected generated Teams variable alignment so a fresh `terraform.tfvars` passes the repository's mandatory recursive format check.
- Preserved legacy Managed Grafana names when they already fit Azure's 23-character limit and used a bounded fallback across all other valid environment and suffix inputs.
- Kept SRE Agent access-mode verification fail-closed when Terraform marks the planned AzAPI body unknown because its managed identity is created in the same apply.
- Preserved Function runtime and app-setting verification when Terraform marks the complete app-settings map unknown due to same-apply identity and SRE endpoint values.
- Updated fail-closed resource-count assertions for the current SRE Agent and Teams Bridge topology, including optional operator role assignments.
- Made profile verification insensitive to Terraform's alignment whitespace and included the fresh-profile AKS node resource group assignment.
- Restricted declarative state-forget actions to the two expected legacy Storage service addresses and excluded them from topology counts.
- Added an optional explicit bounded AKS node-resource-group name for fresh profiles while preserving null behavior for existing clusters to avoid replacement.
- Changed Teams Bridge Blob and Table service configuration to update Azure-created default services instead of attempting conflicting creates, with no-destroy removal blocks for legacy state.
- Allowed deployment to reach the mandatory managed-identity storage cleanup only when Core Tools explicitly reports a successful deployment followed by its premature health-check failure; all other publish errors remain terminal and the final post-restart health gate remains authoritative.
- Configured the `demo` environment fail-closed by removing every deployment policy except the exact `main` branch before writing its OIDC-bound variables and secrets.
- Made deployment-policy cleanup and verification traverse every GitHub API page before authorizing the `demo` environment.
- Added an optional profile marker for fresh bounded AKS node resource group names while allowing legacy profiles to retain missing or null values without cluster replacement.
- Updated the documented canonical immutable GitHub OIDC subject after the repository moved to `msftse-org`.
- Upgraded the backend runtime `perl-base` package to the current fixed Debian release so the mandatory Trivy gate blocks no fixed Critical vulnerabilities.

### 2026-08-24 - Allow read-only SRE Agent node inspection

- Added an AKS-scoped custom role for the existing SRE Agent UAMI containing only `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/nodes/read`.
- Preserved the built-in AKS Cluster User and RBAC Reader assignments; the custom role fills the specific cluster-scoped Node-object gap without granting Kubernetes writes, secrets, exec, RBAC mutation, or cluster administration.
- Extended Terraform verification to require the exact custom data action, AKS scope, service-principal assignment, and updated SRE resource count while excluding separately validated custom roles from built-in-role allowlists.
- Applied exactly one role definition and one role assignment, then verified the live principal, scope, permission set, Checkov `30 passed / 0 failed`, zero destroys, and feature no-drift.
- Proved the correction in a fresh isolated SRE thread: `kubectl get nodes -o wide` completed with managed-identity output, no error, and no approval or OBO record.

### 2026-08-24 - Qualify automatic RCA finalization end to end

- Proved a fresh `Fired` to `Resolved` incident path: the human-merged remediation deployed successfully, one deterministic Durable monitor resumed the same SRE thread, and the SRE Agent reused the existing remediation PR and Teams incident thread.
- Verified that the SRE Agent, not the Function, authored both final destinations and sent byte-identical 6,840-character RCA bodies; the monitor completed with status `finalized`.
- Fixed two live-only Durable worker behaviors found during qualification: an empty SDK status object no longer suppresses a missing orchestration start, and GitHub delivery activities initialize the Teams SDK before proactive sends.
- Added regression coverage for both worker behaviors and completed 134 bridge tests, Ruff, strict mypy, exact 15-Function registration, all continuation/security verifiers, required GitHub CI, and feature Terraform no-drift validation.
- Preserved the governance boundary: Azure SRE Agent still cannot approve, merge, dispatch workflows, deploy, or perform general Azure writes; the alert-reader role contains only `Microsoft.AlertsManagement/alerts/read`.

### 2026-08-23 - Add automatic alert-resolution RCA continuation

- Added Durable processing for signed terminal GitHub continuation events so transient workflow/deployment noise is ignored and downstream Teams/SRE retries no longer block webhook acceptance.
- Added a deterministic alert monitor per recovery merge SHA: poll every 30 seconds for 30 minutes, extend once for 10 minutes, then post one manual-check Teams message if unresolved.
- Added atomic alert-monitor ownership keyed by merge SHA so same-delivery retries continue but separate terminal deliveries cannot start duplicate RCA monitors.
- Added a strict AlertsManagement client and a subscription-scoped custom role containing only `Microsoft.AlertsManagement/alerts/read` for the existing bridge identity.
- Changed finalization so successful deployment is only a milestone; alert state `Resolved` wakes the existing SRE thread, which independently verifies recovery and publishes one identical canonical RCA to the existing Teams incident thread and existing remediation PR.
- Added deterministic alert, webhook, timeout, SRE-finalization, RBAC, and exact Function-registration tests while preserving the human-only merge/deployment boundary.

### 2026-08-20 - Expand first-use fork and workflow guidance

- Documented that fresh forks inherit both tracked GitHub Actions workflow files but not Actions settings, environments, secrets, branch protection, webhooks, Azure resources, Teams installation, run history, or upstream PR records.
- Added a workflow responsibility table, visibility checks, first-use readiness gate, exact **Start Demo** execution sequence, and workflow-specific troubleshooting to `docs/colleague-setup.md` and `README.md`.
- Corrected setup ordering so repository secret `STAGE17_GITHUB_TOKEN` is created before `verify-github-environment.sh`, matching the verifier's actual contract.
- Added a copy-paste coding-agent handoff and an internal first-run contract so agents preserve fork isolation, follow the ordered gates, avoid recreating workflows, and never bypass human merge or secret boundaries.
- Documented the current deferred-RCA limitation: alert resolution does not automatically resume the GitHub-driven continuation, recovery totals are validated inside the Helm test rather than exported as telemetry, and operators must continue the existing SRE thread after recovery evidence is complete.
- Removed the legacy local ACR image-publish step from the colleague path; the supported healthy baseline is built, pushed, and digest-deployed by **Deliver Demo to AKS** through environment-bound GitHub OIDC.

### 2026-08-19 - Merge and qualify Teams SRE answer roundtrip

- Merged the channel and personal Azure SRE Agent answer-roundtrip feature through PR #15 and deployed the exact merged `main` source to the Teams bridge.
- Corrected live-discovered Teams routing behavior so the first authorized channel mention creates a route, follow-ups preserve the original Teams root, null reply IDs normalize safely, and Durable activity workers initialize the Teams SDK before proactive delivery.
- Made failure notifications best effort while guaranteeing route failure-state updates and turn-lock release, preventing delivery failures from stranding conversations.
- Proved channel and personal multi-turn SRE thread reuse, personal `/clear` and `/new`, prompt-free Durable input, portal-only approvals, and complete 19,805-byte multipart delivery as two ordered chunks containing all 500 requested entries.
- Completed 97 bridge tests, Ruff, strict mypy, exact Function registration, connector/skill/response-plan/webhook verification, protected GitHub validation, zero Terraform drift, disabled incident traffic, and zero fired checkout alerts.
- Recorded the residual at-least-once delivery window: if Teams accepts a chunk but the subsequent Table Storage receipt write fails, retry can duplicate that chunk.

### 2026-08-19 - Add Teams SRE answer roundtrip on feature branch

- Added scope-aware channel and personal Teams conversations that create or continue Azure SRE Agent threads and return complete answers through deterministic Durable polling.
- Preserved exact fixed-channel/operator authorization while adding fail-closed personal-chat settings, tenant/user/conversation route isolation, explicit group-chat rejection, one-active-turn locking, deduplication, and per-user hourly limits.
- Added personal `status`, `/new`, and `/clear` behavior, portal-only approval handoff, 10-minute timeout handling, and lossless ordered answer chunking below Teams message-size guidance.
- Added live-schema-grounded SRE message parsing, watermark-relative answer selection, pagination origin checks, and attributed human follow-up messages.
- Added Terraform and colleague-profile controls with secure defaults and no new Azure resource, secret, RBAC role, or connector tool.
- Expanded local bridge validation from 48 to 91 tests; live pre-merge qualification remains required before merge.

### 2026-08-16 - Complete fork onboarding and colleague profile hardening

- Added `docs/colleague-setup.md` with end-to-end fork onboarding, profile generation, identity collection, Actions enablement, Stage 17 token security guidance, deployment flow, sync guidance, and teardown/cost reminders using placeholder-only identifiers.
- Added `scripts/configure-github-environment.sh` and `scripts/verify-github-environment.sh` to idempotently create the Terraform-selected GitHub environment, configure required environment-scoped variables and `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`, and verify environment/repository secret metadata without exposing secret values.
- Hardened `scripts/setup-colleague.sh` and `scripts/verify-colleague-profile.sh` by enforcing explicit `origin` repository validation before repository resolution and repository/profile checks.
- Standardized HCL string escaping helper naming across setup and verifier scripts.
- Updated dry-run handling in `scripts/setup-colleague.sh` so cleanup applies only to script-created temporary output directories and never deletes a user-provided output path.
- Updated `README.md`, `AGENT.md`, and selected stage documents with first-time fork callouts, GitHub environment bootstrap requirements, canonical-maintainer exception guidance, and synchronized project-tree/script listings.
- Expanded `README.md` into an exact fork-to-demo runbook covering profile generation, Azure provisioning, GitHub environment/token setup, Teams secret/bootstrap deployment, healthy baseline delivery, incident execution, recovery, and teardown.
- Added a `Start Demo` fallback that discovers the inherited FIELD20 remediation from first-parent Git history when a fresh fork has no fork-local merged PR metadata.
- Documented Teams tenant, Team, channel, and allowed-user ID discovery through Teams links and Microsoft Graph, including safe context restoration when Teams uses a different tenant.
- Added prerequisite installation, SRE readiness checks, exact Teams secret/sideload commands, demo-day readiness and timing, failure triage, repeat-run criteria, and teardown retry guidance for operational parity with the original demo.
- Enforced the supported topology of one active deployment and fixed `demo` environment per fork, documented the single-tenant bot placement, and made a unique Teams channel mandatory per colleague.

### 2026-08-14 - Document Azure SRE Agent pricing

- Added `azure-sre-agent/pricing/azure-sre-agent-pricing.md` with the AAU billing model, token conversion rates, fixed and variable cost formulas, scenario estimates, allocation controls, related-cost caveats, optimization guidance, and official sources.
- Recorded the live demo agent's 10,000-AAU active-flow allocation and its public-price planning ceiling without treating the allocation as expected spend.
- Linked the pricing guide from `README.md` and added it to the synchronized project trees.

### 2026-08-14 - Refine Azure SRE Agent asset hierarchy

- Moved responder sources under `azure-sre-agent/subagents/sre-agent-responders/`.
- Renamed the custom-skill folder to `azure-sre-agent/skills/` and the RCA template folder to `azure-sre-agent/response-templates/`.
- Updated deployment scripts, live verifiers, project trees, and Stage 14/15 documentation to use the new paths.

### 2026-08-14 - Standardize Azure SRE Agent RCA assets

- Moved custom skill and responder sources under `azure-sre-agent/` while preserving their Azure resource names and capability boundaries.
- Added a canonical Northstar checkout RCA template with fixed incident, impact, timeline, evidence, root-cause, remediation, validation, follow-up, and rollback sections.
- Composed the template into live custom-skill content so GitHub and Teams receive the same rendered RCA format, with deferred status when recovery evidence is incomplete.
- Extended skill and response-plan verification to validate moved paths, required RCA headings, rendering instructions, and byte-identical composed live content.

### 2026-08-14 - Make repeated SRE investigations self-correlating

- Disabled response-plan alert merging so each repeated FIELD20 alert starts a distinct autonomous investigation.
- Added deterministic Azure incident-to-canonical-SRE-thread resolution in the Teams bridge and persisted both identifiers for continuation.
- Updated the remediation skill to use the `sre_thread_id` returned by the Teams tool instead of requiring manual operator input.
- Validated Ruff, strict mypy, 40 bridge tests, Function registration, packaging, live Function health, exact connector tools, skill publication, and response-plan configuration.
- Proved the correction with alert `2020b15d-4eda-5ef1-b9e5-803567f40033`: distinct SRE thread `bc1fdf64-fe8a-458c-b6fa-7fa22a588d1c`, durable Teams correlation, and automatically created human-gated remediation PR #9.

### 2026-08-13 - Add repeatable demo starter

- Removed the `demo` environment reviewer gate so validated incident and recovery merges deploy automatically; retained the main-only branch policy and environment-bound OIDC identity.
- Added a manually dispatched `Start Demo` workflow at `.github/workflows/start-demo.yml` that validates and publishes one intentional-regression commit directly to `main`, then dispatches incident delivery.
- Fixed repeated runs by discovering and inverting the latest merged SRE remediation instead of pinning the first remediation SHA.
- Removed the setup PR so the SRE remediation is the only PR; Start Demo temporarily uses `routine` protection for one direct push and always restores `incident-demo`.
- Disabled response-plan alert merging so a repeated demo cannot be absorbed into a recently resolved investigation without invoking the responder.
- Added recovery-only FIELD20 smoke verification with exact totals and privacy-bounded trace metadata for autonomous final RCA evidence.
- Preserved human merge for the SRE remediation PR; validated incident and recovery merges deploy automatically through the main-only `demo` environment.

### 2026-08-10 - Complete live approval and rejection rehearsal

- Activated the deterministic FIELD20 incident, observed the Sev1 Azure Monitor alert, and completed an evidence-backed Azure SRE Agent investigation in the existing Teams timeline.
- Proved automatic remediation PR creation, human rejection, reopen, user merge, separately approved recovery deployment, exact FIELD20 totals, alert resolution, and final Teams/GitHub RCA.
- Hardened deployment verification, Teams root-thread routing, serial Azure investigation reads, signed continuation verification, and user-merge branch protection based on live findings.
- Added automatic protected recovery startup after a merged same-repository SRE remediation PR while forcing incident traffic off and retaining explicit environment approval.
- Recorded the immutable evidence and lessons in `docs/stages/17-approval-rejection-rehearsal.md`.

### 2026-08-10 - Connect SRE Agent traces to Application Insights

- Wired the managed Application Insights application ID and sensitive connection string into the Azure SRE Agent log configuration.
- Preserved optional observability behavior by omitting the log configuration when Application Insights is disabled.
- Applied one in-place SRE Agent update with zero additions or destroys and verified `Running`/`Succeeded`, the expected Application Insights AppId, and zero Terraform drift.
- Changed incident protection to require validation plus a user-performed merge without a separate approving review; the protected deployment still requires explicit `ij-23` approval.
- Added automatic recovery workflow startup after a merged same-repository SRE remediation PR, with incident traffic forced off and the protected environment approval retained.

### 2026-08-09 - Complete user-owned architecture proposal

- Added the user-created, self-contained Azure SRE Agent architecture proposal at `docs/architecture/sre-agent-demo-architecture.html`.
- Embedded three architecture diagrams and documented the deployed topology, identity model, observability flow, incident automation, continuation bridge, and human approval boundaries.
- Marked Stage 18 complete while preserving Stage 17 as the pending live approval and rejection rehearsal.

### 2026-08-09 - Make deployment documentation environment-portable

- Replaced recreated-environment Azure names, subscription and tenant IDs, endpoints, Team identifiers, public IPs, and generated suffixes with Terraform output or Azure CLI discovery commands.
- Updated the core platform, observability, protected delivery, incident, SRE Agent, and Teams stage records so transient values are either discovered live or explicitly labeled as historical validation evidence.
- Preserved stable application constants, repository identity, local development addresses, and all prior append-only changelog history.
- Executed every documented Terraform output lookup against the current state and completed a repository-wide Markdown scan for stale environment values.

### 2026-08-09 - Add signed GitHub continuation loop

- Added a Key Vault-backed, HMAC-validated GitHub webhook for PR, workflow-run, and deployment-status events.
- Added strict same-repository SRE-branch, main-base, workflow, environment, and thread-marker boundaries for the public repository.
- Added durable PR/merge/SRE/Teams correlation and resumable delivery-ID deduplication in Table Storage.
- Added existing-thread SRE continuation, Teams milestone replies, PR-state verification, and final RCA comment capability without merge or workflow-dispatch tools.
- Hardened Function publishing against Core Tools injecting an empty classic `AzureWebJobsStorage` setting over managed identity.
- Verified 31 tests, signed 202/unsigned 401 delivery, one exact webhook, zero Terraform drift, disabled traffic, zero alerts, and zero open PRs.

### 2026-08-09 - Add autonomous checkout incident responder

- Added a custom checkout responder with no direct tools and access only to the portable checkout remediation skill.
- Added mandatory root and threaded Teams timeline instructions with a fail-closed boundary before source writes.
- Added one active Autonomous Azure Monitor response plan matching only Sev1 `NorthstarCheckoutFailureRatioHigh` alerts with a three-hour recurrence merge window.
- Extended automatic deployment and verification through responder and plan creation in dependency order.
- Proved idempotent bootstrap, no quickstart plan, disabled incident traffic, and zero active checkout alerts.

### 2026-08-09 - Add portable SRE checkout skill

- Added an environment-portable checkout investigation/remediation skill used only by Azure SRE Agent, with runtime discovery for all Azure resource identifiers.
- Removed the abandoned `.github/skills` approach so GitHub Copilot does not discover or execute the skill as repository customization.
- Added native data-plane skill upsert and exact live-content/tool verification derived from Terraform outputs and active Azure context.
- Added a unified deployment bootstrap that configures Teams, GitHub, and the skill in dependency order after every Teams bridge deployment.
- Proved idempotent live installation of one custom skill with nine tools while keeping incident traffic disabled and creating no branch or pull request.

### 2026-08-09 - Validate least-privilege GitHub connector

- Added secret-safe, idempotent Azure SRE Agent registration for GitHub's official remote MCP server.
- Exposed exactly five source-read and branch/commit/PR tools while withholding merge, review, PR mutation, and deployment capabilities.
- Added a repeatable live verifier for connector metadata, branch enforcement, deployment approval, and workflow token restrictions.
- Proved a live read of `README.md` from `main`, connector idempotency, and unchanged human merge/deployment boundaries without creating a branch or pull request.

### 2026-08-09 - Move architecture proposal to the end

- Moved the architecture proposal from Stage 13 to user-owned Stage 18 so it can be run manually with Codex after the full workflow rehearsal.
- Restored GitHub validation, checkout skill, response plan, continuation, and rehearsal to Stages 13-17 while keeping final learning materials and teardown at Stage 19.

### 2026-08-09 - Add Azure architecture proposal stage

- Added Stage 13 for a self-contained, customer-facing HTML architecture design built with the `azure-architecture-proposal` skill.
- Defined the proposal as a greenfield/general Azure design grounded in repository and live Stage 1-12 evidence, with diagrams for topology, closed-loop flow, and approval boundaries.
- Renumbered GitHub validation, checkout skill, response plan, continuation, rehearsal, and teardown through Stage 19.

### 2026-08-09 - Add Teams bridge and automated SRE connector

- Added a Python 3.12 Functions Flex bridge, Azure Bot F0/Teams channel, Durable workflow, keyless storage, Key Vault, UAMI, and a sideloadable Azure SRE Agent Teams package.
- Enforced exact tenant, Team, channel, and operator boundaries on inbound activities and fixed Team matching to use the Graph `aadGroupId` field.
- Exposed only three authenticated MCP tools for fixed-channel root posts, threaded replies, and route lookup; validated 401 without the key and exact discovery with it.
- Added secret-safe, idempotent `northstar-teams` connector creation through the SRE Agent data plane and integrated it into every bridge deployment.
- Verified inbound status, outbound root/reply threading, 13 tests, five live Functions, 62 Terraform resources at zero drift, disabled incident traffic, and zero active checkout alerts.

### 2026-08-09 - Deploy Azure SRE Agent foundation

- Deployed a Stable Azure SRE Agent with native Azure Monitor incident discovery, global Review/Low safeguards, and demo-resource-group knowledge scope.
- Added the required dedicated UAMI and least-privilege monitoring, Log Analytics, and AKS reader roles; granted the operator SRE Agent Administrator only on the agent resource.
- Removed the temporary empty checkout action group because native Azure Monitor scanning discovers fired alerts directly.
- Added Terraform assertions for agent settings, the RBAC allowlist, tags, Checkov, and zero-destroy planning.
- Verified a reachable empty data plane, no quickstart response plan or connectors, 39 Terraform resources at zero drift, a healthy four-pod workload, disabled traffic, and no active checkout alert.
- Added a dedicated Northstar checkout skill stage before response-plan activation and renumbered the remaining roadmap through Stage 18.

### 2026-08-09 - Prepare deterministic checkout incident

- Added a deliberate missing-test regression where valid FIELD20 checkout returns `discount_calculation_failed` with HTTP 500 while health and ordinary checkout remain healthy.
- Added disabled-by-default, failure-tolerant FIELD20 traffic and an explicit GitHub deployment input to activate it later.
- Added a severity-1 Managed Prometheus checkout failure-ratio rule plus an action group reserved for Stage 11 incident routing.
- Validated the alert PromQL against the live healthy baseline and moved persistence into PromQL to maintain complete Checkov parsing.
- Finished with 31 Terraform resources at zero drift, all existing tests passing, live traffic disabled, and zero fired checkout alerts.

### 2026-08-08 - Add protected GitHub Actions delivery

- Added PR-triggered backend, frontend, dependency, and Helm validation plus enforced independent approval on `main`.
- Added repeatable `routine` and `incident-demo` protection profiles so implementation work does not create artificial PRs while the actual SRE remediation flow remains enforceable.
- Added manual `demo` delivery with main-only environment approval, immutable GitHub OIDC, local Docker builds, ACR push, digest-pinned Helm rollout, and live AKS verification.
- Pinned third-party actions and tool versions, added critical-CVE blocking and SPDX SBOM generation, and kept workflow token permissions least-privilege.
- Proved the scan gate failed closed on frontend OpenSSL `CVE-2026-31789`, patched `libcrypto3`/`libssl3`, and passed the replacement workflow.
- Deployed Helm revision 6 from successful run `31112420552` at commit `61f739ca6d55bc734ad67e3171da3b83994c3912` with all replicas and smoke tests healthy.

### 2026-08-06 - Add managed Azure observability

- Enabled AKS managed Prometheus and MSI-authenticated Container Insights with cost-scoped DCR associations and selected control-plane diagnostics.
- Added Log Analytics, workspace-based Application Insights, Azure Monitor workspace, Managed Grafana 12, and least-privilege Grafana reader access.
- Added passwordless Application Insights trace export through AKS workload identity and `Monitoring Metrics Publisher`, preserving disabled local authentication.
- Enabled the Azure Monitor `ServiceMonitor`, backend HTTPS telemetry egress, and global production tracer-provider registration required by the exporter.
- Verified two Prometheus release series, correlated ContainerLogV2 operation/trace records, and Application Insights request/dependency/exception telemetry.
- Kept the live tag audit strict while explicitly reporting Azure's non-taggable, auto-created Failure Anomalies smart detector child.
- Finished with 29 Terraform resources at zero drift and Helm revision 5 healthy at Git SHA `0e23af6890c3`.

### 2026-08-06 - Provision core Azure and AKS platform

- Applied checksum-reviewed Terraform plans for the core platform and an opt-in, cluster-scoped human AKS administrator assignment; final state tracks 16 resources with zero drift.
- Registered the approved `Microsoft.Compute/EncryptionAtHost` prerequisite, provisioned two Ready encrypted Azure Linux AKS nodes, and preserved Azure-managed public IP metadata without replacing `4.223.157.176`.
- Built both AMD64 application images on the local Docker daemon, published them to ACR with `docker push`, and deployed the immutable registry digests through Helm.
- Corrected the Helm test pod identity and backend Cilium policy selector, then passed the backend/frontend in-cluster smoke test under Restricted Pod Security.
- Audited all 13 live resources across the primary and AKS-managed resource groups for `SecurityControl=Ignore`.

### 2026-08-05 - Add modular Terraform foundation

- Added pinned and locked AzureRM, AzureAD, AzAPI, and random providers with local ignored state and explicit provider registration.
- Added focused Terraform modules for resource group, network, ACR, Cilium AKS, GitHub OIDC identity/RBAC, optional observability, and optional Azure SRE Agent.
- Added mandatory shared tags with `SecurityControl=Ignore`, validated naming/CIDR/SKU inputs, and useful deployment outputs.
- Added no-apply core/full planning, Checkov scanning, plan JSON tag auditing, and a post-apply live Azure tag audit script.
- Validated 27 default resources and 33 full-feature resources; no Terraform apply or Azure resource creation occurred.

### 2026-08-06 - Keep shared provider registrations outside environment state

- Recovered safely from an apply that stopped before Azure resource creation because subscription providers already existed.
- Moved provider registration to read-only preflight verification so environment destroy cannot unregister providers shared with other workloads.
- Updated core/full plan expectations to 15 and 21 resources respectively.

### 2026-08-05 - Add hardened images and AKS Helm chart

- Added pinned multi-stage backend and frontend images that install from the Microsoft package proxies and run as non-root users.
- Added unprivileged Nginx same-origin API/health/metrics proxying, SPA fallback, security headers, and container health checks.
- Added an AKS Helm chart with Restricted pod security, probes, resources, immutable digest support, PDBs, NetworkPolicies, optional ingress and traffic generation, and a Helm test pod.
- Added Azure Managed Prometheus ServiceMonitor discovery with Microsoft-required label limits.
- Added Helm values schema validation and a one-shot verifier for builds, restricted runtime smoke tests, chart modes, security assertions, SBOM generation, and cleanup.
- Added a local Docker build-and-push workflow using immutable AMD64 Git-SHA tags and registry digests; no ACR-side build/import command is used.

### 2026-08-05 - Add local observability and release correlation

- Added bounded Prometheus request, latency, in-progress, checkout outcome, and build-info metrics at `/metrics`.
- Added OpenTelemetry server and checkout spans with W3C trace-context propagation and recorded domain exceptions.
- Added structured JSON request and domain-error logs with operation, trace, release, route, status, duration, environment, and instance fields.
- Added `/api/release`, browser-visible correlation headers, and frontend build-SHA display.
- Added three telemetry contract tests and a one-shot verifier that correlates headers, release JSON, metrics, logs, and spans.

### 2026-08-05 - Complete local application review

- Ran the FastAPI service and React storefront together for desktop and mobile review.
- Added both loopback Vite origins to the backend CORS defaults and covered the IPv4 preflight with an API regression test.
- Replaced external runtime image requests with four deterministic local product assets.
- Verified catalogue loading, quantity controls, valid and invalid discounts, checkout confirmation, responsive layout, and browser error state; the user approved the experience.

### 2026-08-05 - Start the healthy application

- Grouped application projects under `src/backend` and `src/frontend`.
- Added a typed, server-priced FastAPI catalogue, discount, and checkout contract with seven API tests and 97.92% coverage.
- Built the responsive Northstar Supply React storefront with accessible cart, discount, checkout, and confirmation states plus three behavior tests.
- Configured npm, uv, and pip fallback resolution to use the Microsoft package-feed proxies.

### 2026-08-05 - Begin repository bootstrap

- Added the initial repository hygiene and documentation skeleton.
- Recorded the confirmed architecture constraints and staged delivery approach.
- Validated the target Azure subscription, inherited Owner access, required provider registrations, Sweden Central resource support, and regional quota headroom.
- Confirmed GitHub administrator access, configured the empty repository as `origin`, and added a repeatable read-only preflight script.
- Completed Stage 1 without creating Azure resources.
