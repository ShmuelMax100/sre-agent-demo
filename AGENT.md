## Key Decisions

- Azure subscription and tenant are deployment inputs; verify them with `az account show` and the ignored Terraform variables before every operation.
- Preferred region: Sweden Central, subject to Stage 1 capability validation.
- Backend: Python 3.12 and FastAPI.
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, and Vite.
- Runtime: AKS with GitHub Actions delivery.
- Infrastructure: Terraform only, with all `.tf` files under `iac/`.
- Terraform state: local and ignored by Git for this learning demo.
- Every taggable Azure resource must include `SecurityControl=Ignore`.
- Teams notifications are mandatory at incident start, during material investigation steps, and at completion with the RCA.
- Human merge of the SRE remediation PR is the source authorization boundary; validated `main` merges deploy automatically through the main-only `demo` environment.
- Credentials, OAuth grants, personal access tokens, and Terraform state must never be committed.
- Default operating model is fork-first for contributors; use `scripts/setup-colleague.sh` and `scripts/verify-colleague-profile.sh` to generate local profile inputs safely.
- Canonical repository operation is a maintainer-only exception and must be explicit.

## Verified Environment

- The active Azure CLI subscription and tenant must match `TF_VAR_subscription_id` and `TF_VAR_tenant_id`; `scripts/preflight.sh` and `scripts/verify-terraform.sh` enforce this.
- VS Code Azure extensions and Azure CLI may use separate authentication contexts. Do not assume they are interchangeable.
- Sweden Central supports the planned SRE Agent, AKS, Managed Grafana, Azure Monitor workspace, Application Insights, Log Analytics, and ACR resource types.
- The active GitHub identity must have `ADMIN` permission on the selected target repository.
- System Python 3.12 is absent; use `uv` to provision the pinned Python 3.12 runtime in Stage 2.

## Conventions

- Implement and validate one stage before opening the next stage.
- Keep changes minimal and preserve an executable validation result for each stage.
- Update `README.md`, `AGENT.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` whenever project behavior or structure changes.
- After Terraform apply in a fork, run `./scripts/configure-github-environment.sh` then `./scripts/verify-github-environment.sh` before any Stage 9+ workflow dispatch.
- Use immutable Git SHA image tags for deployed workloads.
- Keep application code under `src/backend` and `src/frontend`.
- Resolve npm packages through `https://packagefeedproxy.microsoft.io/npm/`.
- Resolve Python packages through `https://packagefeedproxy.microsoft.io/pypi/simple`.
- Build application images on the local/runner Docker daemon and publish them with `docker push`; do not use `az acr build`, `az acr import`, or remote ACR tasks.
- Keep `.demo-profile.env`, `iac/terraform.tfvars`, Terraform state, and plan outputs local and untracked.

## First-Run Contract for Coding Agents

When helping a colleague use a fresh fork, treat [docs/colleague-setup.md](docs/colleague-setup.md) as the authoritative ordered runbook and enforce these rules:

1. Confirm `origin` is the colleague's fork, `upstream` is `msftse-org/sre-agent-demo`, the active branch is the fork's `main`, and the GitHub viewer has `ADMIN` permission. Never target the canonical repository unless the maintainer explicitly uses `--allow-canonical`.
2. A fork inherits `.github/workflows/start-demo.yml` and `.github/workflows/deliver-demo.yml` as tracked files. It does not inherit Actions enablement, environments, secrets, protection, webhooks, Azure resources, Teams installation, workflow history, or PR history. Do not generate replacement workflow files.
3. For an older fork, fast-forward from upstream before setup. The manual **Start Demo** button exists only when `start-demo.yml` is present on the fork's default branch and Actions are enabled.
4. Follow this order without skipping gates: authenticate -> collect Teams IDs -> `setup-colleague.sh` -> preflight/profile verification -> enable and inspect workflows -> Terraform apply -> configure GitHub environment -> create repository `STAGE17_GITHUB_TOKEN` -> verify GitHub environment -> provision bot secrets -> deploy Teams bridge -> run all live verifiers -> configure `incident-demo` protection -> deploy healthy baseline -> run **Start Demo**.
5. `verify-github-environment.sh` must run only after `STAGE17_GITHUB_TOKEN` exists. It checks the fixed `demo` environment, eight environment variables, `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`, and repository secret metadata.
6. **Start Demo** is the only supported incident starter. It validates and directly publishes one intentional regression, then dispatches **Deliver Demo to AKS** with traffic enabled. Do not create the regression manually, dispatch overlapping incidents, bypass branch protection, or force-push.
7. **Deliver Demo to AKS** owns baseline deployment, PR validation, and automatic recovery after a human merges a same-repository `sre/field20-checkout-*` PR. The SRE Agent must never merge or dispatch it.
8. Stop on any failed verifier. Never print or request PAT, bot, webhook, MCP, or connection-string values through chat. Secret values belong only in GitHub Secrets or Key Vault.
9. Before **Start Demo**, prove a healthy baseline, disabled traffic, no open PR, no active delivery, Teams readiness, all control-plane verifiers, and `incident-demo` protection.
10. After recovery workflow success, the bridge monitors the correlated alert for 30 minutes plus one 10-minute extension. `Resolved` wakes the same SRE thread; the SRE Agent independently verifies and publishes one canonical RCA to the existing Teams thread and PR. A timeout/manual-check message is not a successful end state.

## Application Contract

- `GET /health/live` and `GET /health/ready` expose process health.
- `GET /api/products` returns the server-priced synthetic catalogue.
- `POST /api/discounts/validate` normalizes and validates discount codes.
- `POST /api/checkout` reprices products, validates quantities and email, applies discounts, and returns a synthetic confirmation.
- The initial application is intentionally healthy. The deterministic regression is introduced only in Stage 10.

## Local Review Findings

- Serve the frontend from `http://127.0.0.1:5173` and the backend from `http://127.0.0.1:8000` for the documented review path.
- Default CORS configuration permits both `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` Vite origins and has a regression test for the IPv4 preflight.
- Product images are committed static assets under `src/frontend/public/products`; the live app does not depend on third-party image responses.
- Desktop and 390-pixel mobile browser checks passed with no horizontal overflow, console errors, page errors, or failed requests.

## Known Tooling Notes

- FastAPI's current `TestClient` emits a deprecation warning about its `httpx` compatibility layer; tests pass and runtime behavior is unaffected.
- `npm audit --omit=dev` reports zero shipped vulnerabilities. The feed reports 10 high findings in future-version ESLint tooling while recommending contradictory downgrades; no automatic downgrade is applied while lint and build remain clean.

## Observability Contract

- Metrics use the `northstar_` prefix and base units. HTTP labels are limited to method, route template, and status code; checkout outcome is limited to `confirmed` or `rejected`.
- `/metrics` is excluded from request self-instrumentation to avoid scrape feedback.
- `northstar_http_requests_total`, `northstar_http_request_duration_seconds`, and `northstar_http_requests_in_progress` describe request health.
- `northstar_checkout_attempts_total` is the business numerator/denominator used for checkout failure analysis.
- `northstar_build_info` identifies version, Git SHA, image digest, and environment.
- JSON request logs include operation ID, trace/span IDs, route, status, duration, release identity, environment, and instance.
- Domain errors emit a correlated warning with a stable low-cardinality error code. OpenTelemetry checkout spans record the exception message and error status.
- W3C `traceparent` is accepted and propagated; responses expose operation, trace, and build identifiers to allowed browser origins.
- Local and injected test exporters use isolated `TracerProvider` instances. The Azure-enabled production provider is registered globally because the Azure Monitor exporter derives Application Insights resource metadata from the global SDK provider.
- Application Insights ingestion uses AKS workload identity and `Monitoring Metrics Publisher`; local authentication remains disabled.

## Container and Helm Contract

- Backend builds a wheel in `python:3.12.13-slim-bookworm`, refreshes the runtime `perl-base` security package, and copies only its virtual environment into the runtime stage. Runtime UID/GID is `10001`.
- Frontend builds with `node:24.13.1-alpine3.22` and serves static files with `nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:1.29.4-alpine3.23` as UID/GID `101`.
- Build package resolution continues through the committed Microsoft npm and PyPI proxies.
- Nginx has a baked same-origin proxy to the stable `backend` Service. This intentionally avoids runtime configuration writes and init-container permission changes.
- Helm workload pods meet the Kubernetes Restricted profile: non-root, explicit `RuntimeDefault` seccomp, no privilege escalation, dropped `ALL` capabilities, read-only root filesystem, and allowed `emptyDir` only for `/tmp`.
- Service-account token automount and Kubernetes service-link environment injection are disabled.
- The chart supports immutable `repository@sha256:digest` references; Stage 9 delivery must set them for both images.
- `scripts/publish-images.sh` targets `linux/amd64`, uses immutable Git-SHA tags, performs only local `docker build` plus `docker push`, and emits the pushed digests for Helm. It assumes Docker authentication is already established and never accepts credentials.
- Azure Managed Prometheus discovery uses `azmonitoring.coreos.com/v1` with label limits `63/511/1023` required by Microsoft guidance.
- NetworkPolicies allow public/ingress-controller access to frontend, frontend access to backend, monitoring-namespace access to backend metrics, DNS egress, backend HTTPS egress for Microsoft Entra/Azure Monitor, and optional traffic-generator access to frontend.
- Subscription policy inspection found only SQL/data Defender assignments and no AKS workload or registry restriction.
- Docker Scout critical CVE scanning requires an authenticated Docker account in this environment and was not bypassed. SPDX SBOM generation succeeds locally; authenticated vulnerability scanning is required in Stage 9 CI.
- No local Kubernetes cluster is reachable. API-server admission, Cilium policy enforcement, and `helm test` are deferred to the newly provisioned AKS cluster in Stage 7 and must not be reported as already validated.

## Terraform Contract

- All `.tf` files are under `iac/`; child modules use only relative `./modules/<name>` sources.
- State is local for the learning demo. State, plans, `.terraform/`, `terraform.tfvars`, and auto tfvars are ignored. No `backend.tf` exists.
- Providers are pinned and locked: AzureRM 4.81.x, AzureAD 3.9.x, AzAPI 2.11.x, random 3.9.x. AzureRM 5 is intentionally deferred because current implementation guidance and validation target 4.x.
- Subscription and tenant IDs are required variables and are not hardcoded in HCL. AzureRM automatic provider registration is disabled. Shared provider registrations are verified as pre-existing prerequisites and are not imported into environment state, preventing destroy from unregistering providers used elsewhere.
- Root naming uses a persisted six-character random suffix unless a deterministic suffix is supplied. ACR and Grafana names enforce service length/character restrictions. Fresh colleague profiles set a bounded AKS-managed node resource group name; existing deployments can leave it null to preserve the platform-generated name.
- Shared tags are merged at root, with `SecurityControl=Ignore` applied last so callers cannot override it.
- Core modules: resource group, network, ACR, AKS, GitHub Actions identity/OIDC/RBAC.
- Optional modules: observability and AKS monitoring (`enable_observability`) plus SRE Agent (`enable_sre_agent`). Both are enabled in the ignored demo configuration.
- AKS Standard uses Azure CNI Overlay with Cilium, managed identity, OIDC/workload identity, managed Entra authentication, Azure RBAC, disabled local accounts, Azure Policy, Key Vault CSI rotation, Azure Linux ephemeral system disks, host encryption, automatic patch/node-image upgrades, and no node public IPs.
- Teams Bridge updates the default Blob and Table service resources that Azure creates with the storage account, then manages only the demo container and state table as child resources.
- ACR uses Standard SKU, disables admin and anonymous access, and remains public to support the confirmed local Docker/GitHub runner push model. AKS kubelet receives `AcrPull`; GitHub OIDC identity receives `AcrPush` and AKS deployment roles.
- GitHub federation uses the immutable environment subject `repo:msftse-org@318985115/sre-agent-demo@1323141369:environment:demo`, not a broad branch subject. Terraform supports legacy subjects for older repositories when immutable IDs are null.
- Observability creates workspace-based Application Insights, Log Analytics, Azure Monitor managed Prometheus, Managed Grafana 12, and reader RBAC. AKS monitoring owns Prometheus/Container Insights DCR associations, selected control-plane diagnostics, and passwordless telemetry identity/RBAC.
- SRE Agent uses `Microsoft.App/agents@2026-01-01` through AzAPI, Review mode, Low access, `AzMonitor`, and demo-resource-group scope. Its log configuration targets the managed Application Insights component for incident traces and audit telemetry. A dedicated UAMI is attached beside the platform system identity and is referenced by both action and knowledge configuration.
- AKS investigation combines Cluster User for kubeconfig retrieval, built-in RBAC Reader for namespace-scoped workload reads, and a custom cluster-scoped role containing only `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/nodes/read`. RBAC Reader includes node metrics but not core Node objects, so `kubectl get nodes` otherwise falls back to an OBO permission prompt.
- `scripts/verify-terraform.sh` performs no apply. It validates provider prerequisites, agent mode/incident settings, the SRE RBAC allowlist, zero destroys, Checkov, and planned tags across core and full plans.
- Checkov result: 24 passed, 0 failed, 13 explicitly reasoned skips. Skips document confirmed demo constraints (public/single-region/free/Standard/no-CMK) or features intentionally attached in later stages.
- `scripts/audit-tags.sh` is the required post-apply live tag gate. It explicitly reports and excludes only `Microsoft.AlertsManagement/smartDetectorAlertRules`, because Azure auto-creates the Application Insights Failure Anomalies child and neither ARM nor AzureRM exposes writable tags for that type.
- `aks_operator_object_id` is an opt-in Microsoft Entra user object ID for cluster-scoped AKS RBAC administrator access. It defaults to `null`; the ignored demo configuration enables it because subscription `Owner` does not grant Kubernetes data-plane access.
- Azure-managed public IP metadata is ignored through `ip_tags` lifecycle handling so Terraform does not replace the reserved ingress address to remove `FirstPartyUsage=/Unprivileged`.
- Subscription-managed Defender for Containers is preserved through `microsoft_defender` lifecycle handling so AKS monitoring updates cannot disable the external security profile.

## Stage 7 Deployed Platform

- Stage 7 created the core resources under the generated suffix exposed by Terraform and finished with zero drift.
- The AKS output identifies a two-node `Standard_D2ds_v5` Azure Linux system pool with host encryption; query the current Kubernetes version from the live cluster.
- The ACR output identifies the registry containing locally built AMD64 backend and frontend images; Helm uses immutable registry digests.
- Helm release `northstar` runs two ready replicas of each application component in the Restricted `northstar` namespace; revisions are transient.
- The Helm test pod carries release selector labels so Cilium admits only the chart's test identity to backend readiness. The live backend and frontend smoke test passes.
- Managed Prometheus discovery is disabled until Stage 8 creates its CRD and Azure Monitor workspace. The reserved public IP is exposed by Terraform and is not attached to an ingress controller yet.
- The post-apply tag gate passed across the primary and AKS-managed resource groups; resource counts are stage snapshots, not reusable expectations.

## Stage 8 Managed Observability

- Stage 8 finished with zero drift after enabling Azure Monitor managed Prometheus, Container Insights, selected AKS control-plane diagnostics, workspace-based Application Insights, and Managed Grafana.
- Azure Monitor agents are healthy: two metrics and two logs daemon pods, two metrics replicas, one kube-state-metrics replica, and one logs replica.
- Container Insights collects only `ContainerLogV2`, `KubeEvents`, and `KubePodInventory` for namespace `northstar` at a five-minute interval.
- `northstar-sre-demo-backend` scrapes `/metrics` every 30 seconds through the Azure Monitor `ServiceMonitor` CRD.
- Application Insights uses a federated telemetry identity scoped to `Monitoring Metrics Publisher` on the component; no client secret exists.
- Helm release `northstar` runs four ready pods with immutable ACR digests and a passing smoke test; query the current revision and SHA from Helm and `/api/release`.
- Managed Prometheus returned both `northstar_build_info` series, Log Analytics returned correlated operation/trace IDs and 200/422 outcomes, and Application Insights returned Northstar requests, dependencies, and exceptions.
- The Stage 8 tag-gate snapshot audited the deployed resources and skipped one explicitly reported, non-taggable Application Insights smart detector child; counts vary after recreation.

## Stage 9 Protected Delivery

- `scripts/configure-github-protection.sh` switches between `routine` and `incident-demo`. Routine mode permits direct implementation pushes while retaining linear history and force-push/deletion protection. Incident-demo mode additionally requires the validation check, resolved conversations, and admin enforcement; no separate approving review is required because the SRE connector authors PRs as `ij-23`.
- PRs are reserved for fixes authored after an actual SRE Agent investigation; routine implementation stages commit directly. Enable `incident-demo` before the remediation exercise.
- `Start Demo` (`.github/workflows/start-demo.yml`) is the browser entry point. It discovers the latest merged `sre/field20-checkout-*` PR, inverts that merge into one validated incident commit, temporarily applies `routine` protection, pushes directly to `main`, restores `incident-demo`, and dispatches delivery with traffic enabled.
- The manual dispatch is the source authorization for the direct incident commit. The only PR is the later same-repository `sre/field20-checkout-*` remediation, whose human merge starts automatic recovery with traffic disabled. Both deployments use the exact `main` SHA through the main-only `demo` environment without a reviewer gate.
- `STAGE17_GITHUB_TOKEN` should be fine-grained or GitHub App based and limited to repository contents, Actions dispatch, and branch administration. Start Demo fails when any PR or delivery is active and verifies `main` did not move before pushing.
- The `demo` environment accepts only `main` and has no reviewer gate. The SRE remediation PR merge remains the user action; the agent cannot merge it or dispatch deployment.
- Workflow permissions are `contents: read` plus job-scoped `id-token: write`. Third-party actions and tool versions are pinned.
- Images are built on the runner Docker daemon and published with `docker push`; no ACR build/import/task command is used.
- Trivy blocks fixed critical vulnerabilities and generates SPDX SBOMs before deployment. The first run blocked `CVE-2026-31789`; the patched Alpine OpenSSL packages passed the replacement run.
- The successful Stage 9 replacement run deployed a digest-pinned release; all four replicas and the in-cluster Helm test passed. Workflow run IDs and release SHAs are historical evidence in the stage record, not current environment inputs.

## Stage 10 Dormant Checkout Incident

- `checkout()` intentionally returns HTTP 500 with `discount_calculation_failed` only after a valid `FIELD20` quote. Existing tests pass because valid FIELD20 checkout is the deliberate missing case.
- The traffic generator defaults off. When enabled, it submits two `field-pack-28` items with FIELD20 every five seconds and continues after failures.
- The delivery workflow exposes `incident_traffic`; the live incident uses `deploy=true` and `incident_traffic=true` only after SRE Agent and Teams are connected.
- Recovery-mode Helm tests submit one FIELD20 checkout, assert exact totals, and emit a stable operation ID. The backend span records only `FIELD20` versus `other`, never email or request bodies, so the agent can independently verify recovery in Application Insights.
- Managed Prometheus alert `NorthstarCheckoutFailureRatioHigh` is severity 1, requires more than 50% checkout 5xx plus active traffic across two minutes, and auto-resolves after five healthy minutes.
- Azure SRE Agent discovers fired alerts through the native Azure Monitor scanner; the temporary empty action group was removed in Stage 11.
- The healthy Stage 9 image remains deployed, traffic is disabled, and no Stage 10 alert is firing.

## Stage 11 SRE Agent Foundation

- The SRE Agent returned by the nested Terraform output is `Succeeded`, `Running`, and reachable at its generated data-plane endpoint.
- Native incident management is `AzMonitor`. Subscription-scoped Monitoring Contributor lets the UAMI scan, acknowledge, and synchronize Azure Monitor alerts without an action group.
- Resource access uses the UAMI ID returned by the nested SRE Agent output. It has Reader, Monitoring Reader, and Log Analytics Reader on the demo resource group plus AKS Cluster User, AKS RBAC Reader, and the exact custom Node-read data action on the cluster.
- The agent has no Contributor, Owner, AKS admin, sandbox, or VNet integration. Global Review/Low is the fallback; the Stage 15 checkout response plan will use Autonomous mode for connector actions constrained by tool policy and GitHub permissions.
- Azure RBAC updates can take several minutes to propagate. Cancel an OBO prompt created before the managed-identity grant, wait for propagation, and retry in the same SRE thread; granting the old prompt would run that action with the operator's broader credentials instead.
- Direct ARM creation produced no quickstart response plan. Live data-plane collections show zero threads, incident filters, connectors, custom agents, and plugins.
- The 2026 API requires the UAMI resource ID in both `actionConfiguration.identity` and `knowledgeGraphConfiguration.identity`; omitting it returns `InvalidIdentity`.
- The Stage 11 validation finished with zero Terraform drift. Checkov passes 24 checks with zero failures, all four application pods remain Ready, traffic is disabled, and no checkout alert is active; tracked counts vary by enabled features.

## Stage 12 Teams Bridge

- Azure Bot Service F0 forwards Teams activities to Python 3.12 Functions Flex Consumption. The merged answer-roundtrip implementation adds scope-aware Durable activities while preserving the original function names for in-flight orchestration compatibility.
- Channel requests require Bot Connector JWT validation plus exact tenant, Team `aadGroupId`, channel, and operator boundaries. Personal chat is separately configurable, disabled and allowed-user-only by default, tenant/user/conversation isolated, rate limited, and rejects group chat.
- The first authorized mention in a channel conversation creates its SRE route. Later mentioned replies reuse the same SRE thread and preserve the original Teams root even when inbound reply activity IDs change. Personal `status`, `/clear`, `/new`, and normal follow-ups do not require an at-mention.
- User turns poll the preview SRE message API with Durable timers and return only new `SREAgent` text to the originating Teams conversation. Prompts and answers are excluded from routing state, Durable orchestration input, and routine logs; approvals remain portal-only.
- Proactive sends initialize the Teams SDK inside Durable activity workers because those workers can start before any HTTP-trigger initialization. Failure notification is best effort, but route failure state and turn-lock release remain mandatory.
- Multipart answers use UTF-8-aware ordered chunks below Teams message-size guidance. Per-chunk receipts support resume after recorded sends; a narrow at-least-once duplicate window remains if Teams accepts a chunk and the following Table Storage receipt write fails.
- The bridge MCP endpoint requires `x-mcp-key`, keeps DNS-rebinding protection, and exposes only post, threaded reply, and route lookup tools for the fixed destination.
- UAMI access is limited to keyless host storage roles, Key Vault Secrets User, and SRE Agent Standard User. The operator can rotate secrets only in the bridge vault.
- `scripts/configure-sre-teams-connector.sh` performs secret-safe, idempotent data-plane creation/update of `northstar-teams`, accepts API-redacted nulls for write-only fields, and strictly verifies its public metadata and exact three prefixed tools. It is called automatically after every successful bridge deployment.
- Live qualification proved fixed-channel root and follow-up delivery on one SRE thread and Teams root; personal `/clear`, fresh turn, follow-up reuse, and `/new`; and a complete 19,805-byte answer delivered as two ordered chunks containing all 500 requested entries.
- The merged-main validation passed 97 bridge tests, Ruff, strict mypy, Function registration, package and live connector/capability checks. Terraform finished at zero drift with incident traffic disabled and zero fired checkout alerts.

## Stage 13 GitHub Connector

- `northstar-github` connects Azure SRE Agent to GitHub's official remote MCP server and is constrained to seven selected tools: source/PR read, branch creation, multi-file commit, pull-request creation, and final RCA comment.
- Merge, review, Copilot-authored PR, general PR mutation, branch-update, and deployment capabilities are absent from the selected tool set.
- `scripts/configure-sre-github-connector.sh` performs secret-safe MCP discovery, idempotent data-plane registration, and exact saved-tool verification without printing the GitHub credential.
- `scripts/verify-github-connector.sh` validates the live connector and the independent main-branch and protected-environment controls.
- A live `get_file_contents` call read `README.md` from `main`; no branch, commit, PR, workflow, deployment, investigation, or alert was created.
- The demo uses the active `ij-23` GitHub CLI credential, whose scopes are broader than the selected MCP tools. Production should use a dedicated repository-scoped GitHub App or fine-grained service credential.

## Stage 14 Checkout Skill

- `azure-sre-agent/skills/northstar-checkout-remediation.md` is deployment source for an Azure SRE Agent custom skill, not a repository-discoverable Copilot skill; `.github/skills` is absent.
- `azure-sre-agent/response-templates/northstar-checkout-rca.md` is composed into live skill content. Completed RCAs preserve its headings and render the same evidence-backed body in GitHub and Teams.
- `azure-sre-agent/subagents/sre-agent-responders/northstar-checkout-responder.md` supplies the focused custom-agent instructions used by the checkout response plan.
- The skill has eleven temporary tools: read-only Azure investigation, seven constrained GitHub operations, and three fixed-destination Teams operations.
- Runtime instructions discover Azure resource names and IDs from the active incident and live relationships; no environment-specific subscription, resource group, cluster, workspace, namespace, or agent identifier is embedded.
- `scripts/configure-sre-checkout-skill.sh` derives the current agent ID and endpoint from Terraform, validates Azure CLI subscription context, and performs an idempotent native data-plane upsert.
- `scripts/configure-sre-agent-capabilities.sh` configures Teams, GitHub, then the skill and verifies its live content. `scripts/deploy-teams-bridge.sh` invokes this bootstrap after Function health succeeds.
- The live SRE Agent has one custom skill with eleven tools and byte-identical content. Repeated bootstrap runs succeeded without starting an incident or creating GitHub changes.

## Stage 15 Incident Responder

- `northstar-checkout-responder` has no direct tools and exactly one allowed skill, `northstar-checkout-remediation`.
- Its instructions require a Teams root post before source writes and threaded impact, root-cause, PR, blocked/failure, and final-RCA updates.
- Teams root-post failure after one retry blocks branch, commit, and PR creation while allowing read-only evidence collection.
- Active plan `northstar-checkout-response` matches only `Sev1` alerts containing `NorthstarCheckoutFailureRatioHigh`, runs in Autonomous mode, and disables alert merging so repeated demos start distinct investigations.
- No quickstart plan or separate incident-handler resource exists; the focused filter routes directly to the custom responder.
- The unified capability bootstrap now configures Teams, GitHub, skill, responder, and plan in dependency order and verifies each live boundary.
- Full bootstrap passed twice with incident traffic disabled and zero active checkout alerts.

## Stage 16 Continuation Loop

- Autonomous Teams root creation resolves the Azure incident ID to exactly one canonical SRE chat thread, persists both IDs, and returns `sre_thread_id` for the PR continuation marker.
- A public `/api/github/events` route validates GitHub HMAC signatures from the Key Vault-backed `github-webhook-secret`; unsigned requests return 401.
- One repository hook exposes exactly `pull_request`, `workflow_run`, and `deployment_status`; a live GitHub-signed ping returns 202. Transient workflow and deployment-status events are accepted but do not wake SRE.
- Public-repository PR events require the same repository on both sides, base `main`, an `sre/field20-checkout-*` head branch, and exactly one SRE thread marker.
- Workflow/deployment events require the exact delivery workflow, manual dispatch on `main`, `demo` environment, and a previously correlated merge SHA.
- Table Storage persists PR and merge-SHA correlation plus delivery IDs with independent Teams/SRE completion flags for retry-safe deduplication.
- An `alert-monitor` ownership record keyed by merge SHA allows retries of the same delivery while preventing another terminal delivery from starting a duplicate monitor.
- Terminal events are queued through Durable processing so downstream Teams/SRE failures do not escape the webhook request as HTTP 500. Per-delivery destination flags retain retry-safe partial progress.
- Successful recovery workflow completion starts one deterministic monitor per merge SHA. The Function UAMI uses a subscription-scoped custom role containing only `Microsoft.AlertsManagement/alerts/read`, polls for 30+10 minutes, and wakes SRE only after `Resolved`.
- The Function never authors the RCA. The SRE Agent independently verifies recovery and publishes the identical canonical RCA once to the existing Teams thread and existing PR.
- Durable instance startup treats the SDK's non-null status object with `runtime_status=None` as not found, and delivery activities initialize the Teams SDK because a fresh activity worker may not have handled an HTTP request first.
- GitHub continuation added only `pull_request_read` and `add_issue_comment`; merge, review, mutation, dispatch, and deployment tools remain absent.
- Function publishing is hardened to remove Core Tools' empty classic `AzureWebJobsStorage` override and restart before health checks, preserving managed-identity storage.
- Final qualification passed 134 bridge tests, Ruff, strict mypy, exact 15-Function registration, live hook/security checks, required GitHub CI, and feature Terraform no-drift validation.
- A fresh live incident proved `Fired` to `Resolved` monitoring, same-thread SRE continuation, human-authorized recovery, and one byte-identical 6,840-character RCA delivered by the SRE Agent to the existing remediation PR and Teams incident thread. The final monitor output was `finalized`; incident traffic is disabled and no checkout alert remains fired.
