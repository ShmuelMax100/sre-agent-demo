# Run the Demo from Your Own Fork

## First-time fork callout

If this is your first run in a fresh fork, complete this guide in order without skipping steps. It establishes your local profile, Terraform inputs, GitHub environment values/secrets, workflow permissions, and branch-protection mode expected by the stage scripts.

## Using a coding agent for first setup

Give the coding agent access to the cloned fork, then start with this prompt:

```text
Help me configure this fork for its first Azure SRE Agent demo run.

Before running any command:
1. Read AGENT.md and docs/colleague-setup.md completely.
2. Confirm origin is my fork, upstream is msftse-org/sre-agent-demo, the current branch is main, and my GitHub permission on the fork is ADMIN.
3. Confirm .github/workflows/start-demo.yml and .github/workflows/deliver-demo.yml exist on the fork's default branch. Do not create replacement workflows.
4. Show me the active Azure subscription/tenant and GitHub repository identity, then wait for me to confirm they are correct.
5. List the Teams tenant, Team, channel, allowed-user, owner-email, and personal-chat choices you still need. Do not guess identifiers.
6. Never ask me to paste a PAT, bot secret, webhook secret, MCP key, connection string, password, or token into chat. Tell me where I must enter secrets directly.
7. Follow the documented first-run order exactly and stop whenever a verifier fails. Do not bypass checks, branch protection, approvals, or human merge.
8. Before Start Demo, show evidence that the baseline is healthy, traffic is disabled, no PR or delivery is active, Teams is ready, all control-plane verifiers pass, and protection is incident-demo.

Do not provision, deploy, or change GitHub settings until you have reported the checks in steps 1-5 and I confirm them.
```

The colleague must enter secret values directly into GitHub, Key Vault, or an interactive terminal as directed by this guide. A coding agent may verify secret **metadata** after creation, but it must not read, echo, store, or transmit secret values.

## Cost warning (read first)

This demo provisions billable Azure services, including AKS, ACR, Log Analytics, Application Insights, Managed Grafana, Functions, Bot Service, Storage, networking, and Azure SRE Agent resources.

- Provision only in a subscription you are allowed to use for this demo.
- Destroy resources when done: `terraform -chdir=iac destroy`.
- Keep Terraform state local and untracked (`iac/terraform.tfstate*`, `*.tfplan`, `iac/terraform.tfvars`).

## Why fork this repository

Use a personal or team fork so you can run the full incident rehearsal with your own GitHub Actions runs, branch protection, webhook configuration, and Azure credentials without changing the canonical maintainer repository.

## Prerequisites (macOS)

Install and sign in before provisioning:

- Azure CLI (`az`)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`)
- Terraform
- Docker Desktop (or equivalent local Docker daemon)
- `jq`
- `kubectl`
- `kubelogin`
- Helm
- Node.js + npm
- `uv` for Python toolchain management
- Azure Functions Core Tools v4 (`func`)
- ShellCheck
- OpenSSL and `zip`

Install the CLI prerequisites with Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap hashicorp/tap
brew tap azure/functions
brew tap Azure/kubelogin
brew install azure-cli gh hashicorp/tap/terraform jq kubernetes-cli Azure/kubelogin/kubelogin helm node uv shellcheck
brew install azure/functions/azure-functions-core-tools@4
brew install --cask docker
```

If Homebrew asks you to trust a vendor tap, review the prompt and follow your organization’s package policy. Start Docker Desktop before preflight. Git, OpenSSL, `curl`, `zip`, and Python 3 are commonly available through macOS or developer tools; install any missing command before continuing.

Confirm the commands and Docker daemon are available. The full `preflight.sh` check runs after profile generation because it requires `.demo-profile.env`.

```bash
for tool in az docker func gh helm jq kubectl kubelogin node npm openssl shellcheck terraform uv zip; do
  command -v "$tool" >/dev/null || printf 'Missing tool: %s\n' "$tool"
done
docker info >/dev/null
```

## Tenant and subscription model

Use the right identifier in the right place:

- Azure subscription ID: where resources are billed and deployed.
- Azure tenant ID (Microsoft Entra): the identity directory backing that Azure subscription context.
- Teams tenant ID: may differ from the Azure tenant; this is used by the Teams bridge validation and routing.

The single-tenant bot application is created in the Azure deployment tenant (`tenant_id`). `teams_tenant_id` identifies the tenant whose Teams activities the bridge accepts. The original demo has proven these can differ, but each colleague must use values they are authorized to administer.

Use GUIDs in scripts and Terraform (not tenant domains).

Quick check:

```bash
az account show --query '{subscriptionId:id,tenantId:tenantId,user:user.name}' -o json
```

## Fork, clone, and upstream remotes

1. Fork the repository in GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. Configure `origin` to your fork and `upstream` to the canonical repository.

Example:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-org-or-user>/sre-agent-demo.git
cd sre-agent-demo
git remote add upstream git@github.com:msftse-org/sre-agent-demo.git
git remote -v
```

The setup scripts validate `origin` and expect `owner/repository` format.

## What a fork inherits

A fresh fork copies the tracked files from the canonical repository's default branch, including both workflow definitions:

| Workflow file | Actions display name | Trigger and responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.github/workflows/start-demo.yml` | **Start Demo** | Manually creates the intentional FIELD20 regression, validates it, temporarily switches protection, pushes it to the fork's `main`, and dispatches **Deliver Demo to AKS** with incident traffic enabled. |
| `.github/workflows/deliver-demo.yml` | **Deliver Demo to AKS** | Validates pull requests; manually deploys a healthy baseline; and automatically deploys a merged same-repository `sre/field20-checkout-*` remediation with incident traffic disabled. |

Do not recreate, rename, or copy these files manually. `workflow_dispatch` is available only when the workflow file exists on the fork's default branch. If either workflow is missing, the fork is behind upstream; sync `main` before provisioning or running the demo.

A fork does **not** inherit any of the following repository- or environment-owned state:

- GitHub Actions enablement and workflow-permission settings
- the `demo` GitHub environment, its variables, or its secrets
- repository secret `STAGE17_GITHUB_TOKEN`
- branch-protection rules
- GitHub webhook registrations or delivery history
- upstream Actions run history or pull-request records
- Azure resources, Terraform state, bot credentials, or Teams app installation

The fork does inherit Git commit history. **Start Demo** first looks for a fork-local merged FIELD20 remediation PR; on a fresh fork with no local PR history, it deliberately falls back to the inherited first-parent Git history.

## Authenticate Azure and GitHub

### Azure CLI

```bash
az login
az account set --subscription <subscription-id-or-name>
az account show --query '{subscriptionId:id,tenantId:tenantId,user:user.name}' -o json
```

### GitHub CLI

```bash
gh auth login
gh auth status
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner,viewerPermission
```

You must have `ADMIN` permission on your fork.

## Teams identity inputs

Capture these values before setup:

- Teams tenant ID (GUID)
- Team ID (GUID)
- Channel ID (`19:...@thread.tacv2`)
- Allowed user object ID (GUID)

### Teams tenant ID

If Teams uses the same tenant as the active Azure subscription:

```bash
az account show --query tenantId -o tsv
```

If Teams uses another tenant, copy its **Tenant ID** from **Microsoft Entra admin center > Identity > Overview**, or ask the Teams tenant administrator. Use the GUID, not a domain such as `example.onmicrosoft.com`.

### Team ID and channel ID from Teams

In the Teams client:

1. Select the `...` menu next to the Team and choose **Get link to team**. The `groupId=<guid>` query value is the Team ID.
2. Select the `...` menu next to the colleague-specific channel and choose **Get link to channel**. In current links, the URL-encoded value after `/l/channel/` and before the next `/` is the channel ID. Some link formats expose the same value as `threadId`. After URL decoding, it has the form `19:...@thread.tacv2`.

URL-decode a copied channel value on macOS or Linux with:

```bash
python3 -c 'import sys, urllib.parse; print(urllib.parse.unquote(sys.argv[1]))' \
  '<url-encoded-channel-id>'
```

### Team ID and channel ID with Microsoft Graph

When Azure CLI is authenticated to the Teams tenant, list joined Teams:

```bash
az rest \
  --method GET \
  --url 'https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/joinedTeams' \
  --query 'value[].{name:displayName,id:id}' \
  -o table
```

After selecting the Team ID, list its channels:

```bash
TEAM_ID='<team-guid>'
az rest \
  --method GET \
  --url "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/teams/$TEAM_ID/channels" \
  --query 'value[].{name:displayName,id:id,membershipType:membershipType}' \
  -o table
```

Use the exact returned channel ID; do not replace or remove punctuation.

### Allowed user object ID

The allowed user is the colleague permitted to start inbound investigations from Teams. While authenticated to the Teams tenant, run:

```bash
az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv
```

If Teams uses a different tenant from the Azure subscription, preserve the Azure subscription, authenticate to the Teams tenant long enough to collect the values, and then restore the Azure context:

```bash
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id -o tsv)
az login --tenant '<teams-tenant-guid>' --allow-no-subscriptions

az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv
az rest --method GET \
  --url 'https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/joinedTeams' \
  --query 'value[].{name:displayName,id:id}' \
  -o table

az account set --subscription "$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
```

Confirm the original Azure subscription is active again before setup:

```bash
az account show --query '{subscriptionId:id,tenantId:tenantId,user:user.name}' -o json
```

Use placeholders in notes and scripts; never commit real IDs. **Each colleague must use a unique Teams channel.** The Teams tenant and parent Team may be shared, but reusing one channel across deployments mixes incident timelines and makes ownership ambiguous.

## One deployment per fork

This repository supports one active Azure deployment per fork. The GitHub `demo` environment, environment-bound OIDC trust, webhook, secrets, branch protection, `main` history, and Teams bridge are repository-wide. Do not use `--name-suffix` to create parallel environments in one fork; use a second fork for a second simultaneous deployment. The `github_environment` value is intentionally fixed to `demo`.

## Generate local profile and tfvars

Run from repository root:

```bash
./scripts/setup-colleague.sh \
  --teams-team-id <teams-team-guid> \
  --teams-channel-id <teams-channel-id-19-thread-tacv2> \
  --teams-user-object-id <allowed-user-object-guid> \
  --owner-email <owner@example.com>
```

Optional flags:

- `--subscription-id <guid>` and `--tenant-id <guid>` to override active Azure CLI context.
- `--teams-tenant-id <guid>` when Teams tenant differs from Azure tenant.
- `--enable-teams-personal-chat` to allow 1:1 conversations; disabled by default.
- `--teams-personal-chat-access-mode <allowed_user|tenant>` to restrict personal chat to the configured user (default) or all authenticated users in the configured Teams tenant.
- `--teams-personal-chat-turns-per-hour <1-100>` for the per-user personal-chat cost/abuse limit (default `10`).
- `--name-suffix <4-8-lowercase-alnum>` for deterministic naming.
- `--output-dir <path>` and `--dry-run` for render checks.
- `--allow-canonical` only for canonical maintainers intentionally targeting `msftse-org/sre-agent-demo`.

Generated local files:

- `.demo-profile.env`
- `iac/terraform.tfvars`

Security characteristics:

- Both files are mode `0600`.
- Both files are local and git-ignored.
- No PAT, webhook secret, bot secret, or storage key is written there.
- Channel authorization always remains locked to the configured tenant, Team, channel, and allowed user. Personal tenant mode does not relax that channel boundary.
- Personal routes are isolated by tenant, user, and conversation. Group chats and cross-tenant requests are rejected.

## Mandatory preflight and profile validation (immediately after setup)

Run these right after `setup-colleague.sh` and before any Terraform action:

```bash
./scripts/preflight.sh
./scripts/verify-colleague-profile.sh
```

Run `preflight.sh` first: it checks required tools and invokes the profile verifier. The explicit second command is a readable checkpoint and should also pass.

Offline profile validation is available:

```bash
./scripts/verify-colleague-profile.sh --offline
```

## Enable GitHub Actions in your fork

Open your fork settings page and set policy exactly:

1. `Settings` -> `Actions` -> `General`
2. Enable Actions for this repository if prompted.
3. Under `Workflow permissions`, choose `Read repository contents permission`.
4. Leave `Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests` disabled.
5. Save.

Workflows request any additional permissions explicitly. The direct-main incident rehearsal uses the separately scoped `STAGE17_GITHUB_TOKEN`; it does not require write access from the default workflow token.

Baseline check:

```bash
REPOSITORY=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner')
gh workflow list --repo "$REPOSITORY" --all
gh workflow view start-demo.yml --repo "$REPOSITORY"
gh workflow view deliver-demo.yml --repo "$REPOSITORY"
```

Expected result:

- `Start Demo` is listed and supports manual dispatch.
- `Deliver Demo to AKS` is listed.
- Both workflow files resolve from the fork, not from `msftse-org/sre-agent-demo`.

If GitHub shows **Workflows aren't being run on this forked repository**, select **I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them** in the fork's Actions tab, then rerun the commands. If `gh workflow view` reports that a workflow cannot be found, sync the fork from upstream and confirm the files exist on the fork's default `main` branch.

## Stage checkpoints before apply

Review these stage contracts before provisioning:

- Stage 6 foundation: [docs/stages/06-terraform-foundation.md](stages/06-terraform-foundation.md)
- Stage 9 protected delivery: [docs/stages/09-protected-github-delivery.md](stages/09-protected-github-delivery.md)

Recommended checkpoint commands:

```bash
./scripts/verify-terraform.sh
```

## Terraform apply and GitHub environment bootstrap

Run:

```bash
terraform -chdir=iac init
terraform -chdir=iac validate
terraform -chdir=iac apply
./scripts/configure-github-environment.sh
```

Provisioning commonly takes 20–40 minutes. Before deploying the bridge, confirm the SRE Agent reports `Succeeded` and its data plane answers:

```bash
SRE_AGENT=$(terraform -chdir=iac output -json sre_agent)
SRE_AGENT_ID=$(jq -r '.id' <<<"$SRE_AGENT")
SRE_AGENT_ENDPOINT=$(jq -r '.endpoint' <<<"$SRE_AGENT")
az resource show --ids "$SRE_AGENT_ID" --api-version 2026-01-01 \
  --query properties.provisioningState -o tsv
SRE_TOKEN=$(az account get-access-token --resource https://azuresre.dev \
  --query accessToken -o tsv)
curl --fail --silent --show-error \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $SRE_TOKEN" \
  "${SRE_AGENT_ENDPOINT%/}/api/v1/threads" | jq 'length'
unset SRE_TOKEN
```

`configure-github-environment.sh` resolves repository and environment, creates the environment idempotently, and configures these environment variables:

- `ACR_LOGIN_SERVER`
- `AKS_NAME`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- `RESOURCE_GROUP`
- `TELEMETRY_CLIENT_ID`
- `GRAFANA_URL`

It also configures the environment secret `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`.

Do not run `verify-github-environment.sh` yet. It validates the repository-level `STAGE17_GITHUB_TOKEN` as well as the environment, so create that token in the next section first.

## Configure Stage 17 token safely (repository-level secret)

Create repository secret in your fork UI:

1. `Settings` -> `Secrets and variables` -> `Actions`
2. `New repository secret`
3. Name: `STAGE17_GITHUB_TOKEN`
4. Value: fine-grained PAT for this fork only

Required fine-grained PAT repository permissions for the direct-main rehearsal flow:

- `Contents`: Read and write
- `Actions`: Read and write
- `Pull requests`: Read
- `Administration`: Read and write (required for branch-protection mode switch)

Store this token only as the Actions repository secret. Never print it in logs or commit it to files.

After creating the repository secret, verify the complete GitHub control plane:

```bash
./scripts/verify-github-environment.sh
```

This command must pass before baseline deployment or **Start Demo**. It checks:

- the fork's fixed `demo` environment exists;
- all eight environment variables exist, are non-empty, and match Terraform outputs;
- environment secret `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` exists;
- repository secret `STAGE17_GITHUB_TOKEN` exists.

GitHub exposes only secret metadata, never secret values. A verifier failure for `STAGE17_GITHUB_TOKEN` means the secret is missing or was created at environment scope instead of repository scope.

GitHub PAT documentation:

- <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token>
- <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token>

The supported colleague path does not publish application images locally. **Deliver Demo to AKS** authenticates to ACR through GitHub OIDC, builds the images on the runner, pushes them, and deploys immutable digests during the healthy-baseline workflow.

## Configure branch protection for incident rehearsal

After the GitHub environment verifier passes, set incident-demo protection mode:

```bash
./scripts/configure-github-protection.sh incident-demo
```

## Deploy Teams bridge and capability bootstrap

```bash
SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(terraform -chdir=iac output -raw subscription_id)
TEAMS_BRIDGE=$(terraform -chdir=iac output -json teams_bridge)
BOT_APP_ID=$(jq -r '.bot_client_id' <<<"$TEAMS_BRIDGE")
KEY_VAULT=$(jq -r '.key_vault_name' <<<"$TEAMS_BRIDGE")

./scripts/provision-teams-bot-identity.sh store-secrets \
  --subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION_ID" \
  --app-id "$BOT_APP_ID" \
  --key-vault "$KEY_VAULT"
./scripts/deploy-teams-bridge.sh
```

`deploy-teams-bridge.sh` packages the Teams app and configures the Teams/GitHub connectors, checkout skill, responder, response plan, and signed GitHub webhook. Do not run `package-teams-app.sh` separately.

Sideload `.teams-package/azure-sre-agent.zip` through **Teams > Apps > Manage your apps > Upload an app > Upload a custom app**, choose **Add to a team**, and select the configured Team. In the configured channel, send `@Azure SRE Agent status`; the bot should report that the bridge is ready. If upload is disabled, contact the Teams tenant administrator.

If personal chat is enabled, open the app from **Teams > Apps** and send `status` without mentioning the bot. Normal personal messages create or continue that user's active SRE thread. `/new` starts a fresh thread (`/new <question>` starts it immediately), and `/clear` removes local routing without deleting portal history. Channel follow-ups must at-mention the bot; personal messages do not. Answers are returned in ordered parts for up to 10 minutes per turn. Questions requiring SRE approval are shown in Teams, but approval or rejection remains in the SRE Agent portal.

## Live verifiers

```bash
./scripts/verify-teams-bridge.sh
./scripts/verify-github-connector.sh
./scripts/verify-checkout-skill.sh
./scripts/verify-checkout-response-plan.sh
./scripts/verify-github-continuation.sh
```

These checks validate the Function/package, connector allowlists, composed skill and RCA template, responder/response plan, and signed continuation webhook. `verify-containers.sh` and `verify-observability.sh` are local-development gates; `verify-deployment.sh` is called by the delivery workflow with exact image digests and is not a standalone no-argument check.

## Run the demo end to end

### First-use readiness gate

Do not run **Start Demo** merely because it appears in the Actions tab. Before the customer joins, confirm every item below:

```bash
REPOSITORY=$(terraform -chdir=iac output -raw github_repository)

gh workflow view start-demo.yml --repo "$REPOSITORY"
gh workflow view deliver-demo.yml --repo "$REPOSITORY"
./scripts/verify-colleague-profile.sh
./scripts/verify-github-environment.sh
./scripts/verify-teams-bridge.sh
./scripts/verify-github-connector.sh
./scripts/verify-checkout-skill.sh
./scripts/verify-checkout-response-plan.sh
./scripts/verify-github-continuation.sh

gh pr list --repo "$REPOSITORY" --state open
gh run list --repo "$REPOSITORY" --workflow deliver-demo.yml --limit 10
kubectl get deployments --namespace northstar
helm get values northstar --namespace northstar -o json \
  | jq '.trafficGenerator.enabled // false'
```

Required findings:

- the healthy baseline deployment succeeded;
- backend and frontend show `2/2` ready replicas;
- the traffic-generator value is `false` and no incident delivery is active;
- `@Azure SRE Agent status` succeeds in the configured Teams channel;
- all control-plane verifiers pass;
- no pull request is open and no delivery workflow is active;
- branch protection is `incident-demo`;
- `main` contains an inherited or fork-local FIELD20 remediation that **Start Demo** can invert.

### What happens when Start Demo runs

1. Trigger **Start Demo** in GitHub Actions and enable its confirmation checkbox; false confirmation skips the job.
2. The workflow refuses to proceed when any PR or delivery is active.
3. It finds the latest fork-local remediation, or the inherited remediation commit on a fresh fork.
4. It reverts that remediation into one intentional incident commit and validates the exact two-file change.
5. It temporarily changes `main` protection to `routine`, pushes the incident commit with `STAGE17_GITHUB_TOKEN`, restores `incident-demo`, and dispatches **Deliver Demo to AKS** with `incident_traffic=true`.
6. Allow several minutes for image delivery, two one-minute alert windows, and the SRE investigation.
7. Follow Teams evidence and review the generated `sre/field20-checkout-*` remediation PR. The agent cannot approve, merge, or deploy it.
8. Merge the PR when ready. Its human merge automatically starts **Deliver Demo to AKS** with incident traffic disabled; this demo has no separate environment-review approval.
9. Confirm the deployed merge SHA, healthy replicas, successful FIELD20 checkout, and absent traffic generator.
10. The bridge polls the correlated alert every 30 seconds for up to 30 minutes, followed by one automatic 10-minute extension. When the alert reports `Resolved`, it wakes the existing SRE thread for independent verification and final RCA publication to the existing PR and Teams thread.

### Alert-resolution monitor behavior

The existing signed GitHub webhook starts one deterministic Durable monitor after the correlated recovery workflow completes successfully. It does not create another webhook, PR, SRE thread, or Teams thread. The bridge identity has a custom read-only role containing only `Microsoft.AlertsManagement/alerts/read`.

Normal flow:

1. The recovery workflow succeeds and its signed terminal event is durably processed.
2. The alert monitor waits through Azure Monitor's normal recovery window.
3. On `Resolved`, the bridge wakes the same SRE thread with merge, PR, alert, and signed workflow evidence.
4. The SRE Agent independently verifies release, workloads, FIELD20 telemetry, residual failures, and alert state.
5. The SRE Agent publishes one identical canonical RCA to the existing PR and existing Teams incident thread.

If Teams reports that automatic monitoring ended without resolution, do not rerun **Start Demo** or create another remediation branch. Inspect Azure Monitor and continue the existing SRE thread manually. This message appears only after the 30-minute monitor and 10-minute extension expire, or when alert correlation/RBAC is terminally invalid.

After a successful recovery, wait for alert resolution, no open PR, idle delivery, and a completed RCA before running **Start Demo** again. No manual Table Storage cleanup is required.

Troubleshooting map:

- Workflow configuration: `./scripts/verify-github-environment.sh`
- Teams transport: `./scripts/verify-teams-bridge.sh`
- GitHub tools: `./scripts/verify-github-connector.sh`
- Skill/responder/plan: `./scripts/verify-checkout-skill.sh` and `./scripts/verify-checkout-response-plan.sh`
- Webhook continuation: `./scripts/verify-github-continuation.sh`
- Alert signal: Azure Monitor alert `NorthstarCheckoutFailureRatioHigh` and the `northstar-sre-demo-traffic` deployment

Workflow-specific failures:

| Symptom | Meaning and next action |
| --- | --- |
| **Start Demo** is absent from Actions | Enable Actions in the fork and confirm `.github/workflows/start-demo.yml` exists on the fork's default `main`; sync upstream if missing. |
| **Start Demo** is visible but has no **Run workflow** button | The workflow file is not on the default branch, Actions are disabled, or the viewer lacks write access to the fork. |
| Job is skipped immediately | The confirmation checkbox was left false. Run it again with confirmation enabled. |
| `STAGE17_GITHUB_TOKEN is required` | Create that exact **repository-level** Actions secret; an environment secret is the wrong scope. |
| No inherited FIELD20 remediation was found | Sync from the current upstream `main`, then rerun; do not hand-edit an incident commit. |
| A PR or delivery is already active | Wait for it to finish or resolve it. The workflow fails closed to avoid overlapping incidents. |
| Push to `main` is rejected | Verify the token has Contents and Administration write permissions and rerun `./scripts/configure-github-protection.sh incident-demo` after correcting access. Never force-push. |
| Baseline dispatch fails before Azure login | Rerun `./scripts/verify-github-environment.sh` and compare environment values with Terraform outputs. |
| Recovery merge does not deploy | Confirm the merged PR is same-repository, targets `main`, and its branch starts with `sre/field20-checkout-`; then inspect **Deliver Demo to AKS**. |
| Recovery succeeds but automatic monitoring ends without an RCA | Follow **Alert-resolution monitor behavior** above. Inspect Azure Monitor and continue the existing SRE thread; do not create another PR. |

## Keep your fork synced with upstream

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge --ff-only upstream/main
git push origin main
```

If fast-forward is not possible, rebase your work branch on updated `main`, resolve conflicts, then rerun relevant verifiers.

## Local state and sensitive-file reminder

Do not commit these local files:

- `.demo-profile.env`
- `iac/terraform.tfvars`
- `iac/terraform.tfstate*`
- `iac/*.tfplan`

## Teardown and cleanup

Destroy the deployment after the demo:

```bash
RESOURCE_GROUP=$(terraform -chdir=iac output -raw resource_group_name)
terraform -chdir=iac destroy
az group exists --name "$RESOURCE_GROUP"
```

The group-existence command must return `false`. Azure may temporarily report asynchronous deletion or subnet-in-use errors. Wait for platform cleanup and rerun `terraform destroy`; do not delete entries from Terraform state to suppress the error. Verify the resource group is gone, remove the custom Teams app when no longer needed, revoke the fine-grained PAT, and remove the fork’s demo secrets. Stopping Azure SRE Agent does not stop its always-on charge; deletion does.
